# CatPhaser
By **Cindy Le** and **Xueyan Xie**

##Introduction
This is a game where the user can control a cat to move it to a bubble(destination). After the cat reaches the bubble, the user will go to the next level of game. We will use another framework to create this game.

##How to Play
* Use ← and → to control the cat's direction and use ↑ to jump.
* You can only jump if you touch a block.
* If the cat exits the screen from the border on the left, right or bottom, you will lose a life. When you don't have any life left, the game is over.
* If the cat eats a star, you will get 10 points.
* If the cat eats a diamond, you will gain an extra life.
* If the cat reaches the bubble, you will go to the next level.
* You can register or log in. After you log in, you will see you highest score. If you are a new user, your current highest score will automatically be 0 when the game starts.
* After the game is over, click "sync my score" to synchronize your score to the database. If you click this button when the game is notover, your score will not be synchronized.
